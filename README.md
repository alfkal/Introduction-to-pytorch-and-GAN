# Introduction to PyTorch and GAN

Introduction to Machine Learning and PyTorch by using GAN to generated images.

A course presented for Sopra Steria Norway

# Getting started
1. Clone this github repo.

2. Install PyTorch. In this project we use python 3.6.1:

```sh
$ pip3 install torch torchvision
```
Alternative: download the wheel file from [pytorch](http://pytorch.org).

3. Install all the required python dependencies using pip3.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

# Where do I begin?

It is recommended to start by implementing the generator and discriminator found in the task folder. The folder contains 4 files, Generator.py, Discriminator.py, Utils.py and Main.py, each file contains skeleton code and is marked with `TODO` where it is required for you to implement something. In the folder solution, there is a full solution of the task but it is recommended to give it a proper try before looking at the solution.
